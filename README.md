# AI Malnutrition Risk Prediction
**UN SDG 2: Zero Hunger**

---

## 📌 What This Project Does
This project predicts whether a child is at risk of malnutrition using simple information like age, weight, height, meals per day, and access to clean water.  
It helps NGOs and health workers **identify at-risk children early**, supporting timely intervention.

---

## 🎯 The Problem
Malnutrition affects millions of children worldwide, causing stunted growth, health problems, and poor cognitive development.  
Traditional detection is slow and often misses children who need help early.

---

## 💡 Our AI Solution
- **Type:** Machine Learning (Supervised Learning)  
- **Algorithm:** Logistic Regression  
- **Input Data:** Age, Weight, Height, Meals per day, Access to clean water  
- **Output:** Risk of malnutrition (0 = Not at risk, 1 = At risk)  

The computer learns from examples of children with known risk and predicts for new children.
